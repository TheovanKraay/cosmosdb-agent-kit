"""
Data Integrity Tests for Healthcare Appointments
==================================================

These tests verify that the application correctly persists data to
Cosmos DB. They connect directly to the emulator to check:
- Documents exist with correct structure
- Partition keys are set correctly
- Data types are correct in stored documents

These tests help identify Cosmos DB best practice gaps that the
API contract tests alone can't catch (e.g., bad partition key choices,
missing indexing, wrong data model decisions).
