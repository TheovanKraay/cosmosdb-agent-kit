# cosmos-sdk-skills-bench

A skill-efficacy benchmark that measures whether a coding agent obeys a loaded
Cosmos DB best-practices skill set (`skills/cosmosdb-best-practices`) when building
services backed by Azure Cosmos DB.

> **Scope (current):** This benchmark is intentionally scoped to the single
> **`mosaic-python`** task. The dataset, images, and weekly pipeline run and
> grade only that one instance. The full three-scenario × five-SDK matrix
> (15 Harbor tasks) is preserved on the `yumnahussain/all-15-tasks-backup`
> branch and can be restored to expand coverage later. Sections below that
> mention "five SDKs" or "15 tasks" describe that future full matrix.

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Domain | Key Testing Angles |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Mosaic** | User-profile CRUD (4 endpoints) | Singleton, preferred regions, retry, diagnostics |

*(Future scenarios — TicketWave event ticketing, SensorGrid IoT telemetry —
and the .NET/Java/Node.js/Go SDK variants live on the backup branch.)*

Every instruction is deliberately silent about Cosmos-specific best
practices; the agent is supposed to pick them up from its loaded skills,
not from the prompt.

```

## What gets evaluated

Per the spec, the grader scores these categories (see
[Coverage matrix](#coverage-matrix) for which categories run on which SDK):

1. **Live behavior (primary, hard to game)** — `check_behavior.py` builds
   and starts the app, drives the HTTP API, then **independently reads the
   Cosmos emulator with the verifier's own client** and asserts the two
   agree: every created user is a real Cosmos document (an in-memory /
   SQLite store that never writes to Cosmos fails here), the API read/list
   paths match the persisted documents, the partition-key value equals the
   user id, a duplicate `POST` is rejected without creating a second
   document, and the city filter returns exactly the matching rows. This is
   the defensible core — it proves runtime behavior, not source tokens.
2. **API conformance** — live HTTP probes of `/health`, `POST /users`,
   `GET /users/{id}`, `GET /users?city=...`. Right status codes, right
   payload shapes, right round-trip values.
3. **Cosmos data shape** — partition keys are userId-shaped (not `/id`,
   not `/city`), indexing policy present, throughput configured,
   documents carry a type discriminator + schemaVersion + ISO-8601
   `createdAt` + `interests` as a string array.
4. **Source-code best practices (secondary, static)** — singleton client,
   preferred regions (where the local rule covers the SDK), Direct
   connection mode for .NET and Java only, retry/resilience configured,
   diagnostics enabled, lifecycle/disposal handled. These are client-side
   configuration a single-node local emulator **cannot** prove
   behaviorally (lessons doc §15/§16), so they stay as source signals and
   are clearly labeled as such in `check_source.py`.
5. **Skills compliance** — no hardcoded account keys, endpoint read from
   env, no Python `ConnectionPolicy` mutation, no abandoned
   `Azure.Cosmos` preview package in .NET, latest non-deprecated SDK
   used in every SDK.
6. **Anti-gaming hygiene** — comments are stripped before the
   source-code regex checks, and required patterns demand real SDK
   identifiers, not just keywords.

## Reward model

Each task's `tests/test.sh` writes `0` or `1` to
`/logs/verifier/reward.txt`, per the Harbor contract. A run scores `1`
only when **every** mandatory check passes. The pytest run is
**verbose** even on success — the `/logs/verifier/` directory holds a
per-check log (`api.log`, `cosmos.log`, `source.log`, `skills.log`) so a
failing run is debuggable by inspecting which check rejected it.

> **Note:** If the evaluation harness accepts graded float rewards (this is documented
> as a future direction in the wiki), the runner is easy to switch over.
> See `shared/verifier/runner.sh` for the conversion point.

scope for this SDK in this benchmark.

## Container architecture

Each task image is built `FROM cosmos-mosaic-base`. The base image
contains:

- The Cosmos DB Linux **vnext** emulator binaries (small, fast startup,
  starts in the background; ENTRYPOINT is overridden so the verifier
  controls lifecycle).
- Python 3.12 + `pytest`, `requests`, `azure-cosmos`, `pyyaml` for the
  verifier (the verifier always runs in Python regardless of the SDK
  being evaluated).
- `/verifier/` — the shared grader library, copied in once.
- `/logs/verifier/` — the directory the reward + per-check logs are
  written to.
- `start-emulator.sh` — used by every task's `test.sh` to launch the
  emulator and wait for readiness.

Per-task images add only the SDK runtime (`python:3.12-slim`'s site
packages, `dotnet/sdk:8.0` layers, `eclipse-temurin:21-jdk`,
`node:20-bookworm`, `golang:1.22`) plus the per-task `/reference/`,
`/tests/`, `/instruction.md`, `/solution/`. The agent's workspace is
`/app/`.

## Building locally (Harbor)

The repository is laid out for `harbor-format-curation`. To build the
shipped image locally:

```bash
cd cosmos-sdk-skills-bench
harbor-format-curation import mosaic.toml
harbor-format-curation build --profile local mosaic.toml
harbor-format-curation update-database --profile local mosaic.toml
```

The vertical-slice walkthrough is documented in `tasks/mosaic-python/`.
That task was built first end-to-end to prove the architecture; the
backed-up SDK/scenario variants follow the same pattern.

## Validating before merging

Per the internal "Bring Your Own Benchmark Repository" guide,
once your images are built and pushed you can run the benchmark
without contributing to the central benchmarks repo:

```bash
msbench-cli run \
  --config fix_validation \
  --benchmark cosmos-sdk-skills \
  --dataset msbench-registration/dataset.jsonl
```

## What is _not_ in this repo

- The Cosmos DB best-practices skill set itself. That lives in
  `cosmosdb-agent-kit/skills/cosmosdb-best-practices/` in the sibling
  repo. The benchmark only measures obedience to those rules; it does
  not own them.
- The local `cosmosdb-agent-kit/testing-v2/` harness. That is a
  separate, lighter-weight pytest harness for local iteration, not an
  skill-efficacy benchmark.

## CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

A GitHub Actions workflow at `cosmosdb-agent-kit/.github/workflows/msbench-eval.yaml`
automates the evaluation loop:

```bash
# Runs the single mosaic-python instance × 3 independent attempts
msbench-cli run --benchmark cosmos-sdk-skills --repeat 3 --runner shared/ces/runner.sh
```

**How it works:**
1. Workflow is triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
2. Authenticates to Azure as the person who triggered the run (`az login --use-device-code`), so the evaluation harness submits under their own entitlement
3. Runs `scripts/msbench-eval.py` which submits one `--repeat 3` run
4. The evaluation harness executes the mosaic-python instance × 3 attempts = 3 tasks
5. Results are merged with `--merge pass_at_k` for per-instance reliability
6. If the instance's average pass rate < 90%, `scripts/create-skills-issue.py` creates a GitHub issue mapping failures to specific `sdk-*` rules

**Runner:** `shared/ces/runner.sh` copies the `cosmosdb-best-practices` skill
into the agent's personal skills directory (`~/.copilot/skills/`) as a normally
discoverable skill, then drives the **default** agent with **no hint** to use
it. This keeps the benchmark an honest measurement of the skill's *organic*
effect — does an agent that merely has the skill installed apply the Cosmos DB
best practices? — rather than a hinted best case.
