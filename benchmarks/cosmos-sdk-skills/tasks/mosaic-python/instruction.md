# Mosaic — User Profile Service (Python)

You are building **Mosaic**, a local-experiences marketplace. The first
piece is a small user-profile service. The service is backed by **Azure
Cosmos DB for NoSQL**, and the **Cosmos DB emulator** is already running
inside this container at the standard endpoint.

You can find the emulator endpoint and key in your environment:

```
COSMOS_ENDPOINT  = http://localhost:8081
COSMOS_KEY       = <well-known emulator key, already set>
COSMOS_DATABASE  = mosaic
COSMOS_USERS_CONTAINER = users
```

Your code **must** read those values from the environment, not from
hardcoded literals.

## What you are building

A Python HTTP service exposing four endpoints. The service must use
**Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** (no SQLite, no in-memory dict) to store
user profiles, and reads/writes must go through the official Cosmos
Python SDK.

### API contract

| Method | Path                       | Purpose                          | Success status |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| GET    | `/health`                  | Liveness probe                   | `200` with `{"status": "ok"}` |
| POST   | `/users`                   | Create a user                    | `201` with the created user |
| GET    | `/users/{id}`              | Read one user by id              | `200` (or `404` if missing) |
| GET    | `/users?city=<city>`       | List users filtered by city      | `200` with a JSON array (empty if none) |

`POST /users` accepts JSON with these fields:

```json
{
  "id": "u-alpha",
  "name": "Alpha",
  "email": "alpha@example.com",
  "city": "Seattle",
  "interests": ["climbing", "coffee"]
}
```

All four input fields (`name`, `email`, `city`, `interests`) are
required. The order of items in `interests` must round-trip exactly.
`POST` with an already-used `id` should return `409`.

### Scale to keep in mind

You don't have to handle the scale, just **model** for it: Mosaic
expects ~5M users, ~90/10 read/write, and most reads are by user id
with a long-tail of city-filtered lists.

## Build and run conventions (verifier contract)

The verifier in this container is language-agnostic. It expects:

1. Your final source code lives under `/app/`.
2. You produce **`/app/build.sh`** — a one-shot setup script the
   verifier will run first. For Python this typically does
   `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `pip install` of your
   `pyproject.toml`).
3. You produce **`/app/run.sh`** — a foreground process that starts the
   HTTP server and listens on port `$APP_PORT` (defaults to `9080`).
   The verifier waits up to 90 seconds for `GET http://localhost:$APP_PORT/health`
   to return `200`. The server must stay in the foreground (no
   `nohup`, no `&`).

Both scripts will be `chmod +x`'d by the verifier if needed.

## How you will be graded

A pytest-based verifier runs after your service starts. It builds and
starts your service, drives the HTTP API, and then **independently reads
the Cosmos emulator with its own client** to confirm what you actually
persisted. It checks that:

- every created user is a real Cosmos document (an in-memory or SQLite
  store that never writes to Cosmos fails here),
- the documents the API returns match what is actually stored,
- a duplicate `POST` is rejected without creating a second document, and
- the city filter returns exactly the matching rows.

It also checks that all four endpoints behave per the API contract
above, with the right status codes and payload shapes.

The grader writes a binary reward (`1` if everything passes, `0`
otherwise) to `/logs/verifier/reward.txt`. Per-category logs land in
the same directory.
